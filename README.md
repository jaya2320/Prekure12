## Short Description
### What's the problem ?

Cancer is a dreadful disease. 80% to 90% of all cancers are the result of the things we do to ourselves. Among all cancer women breast cancer is the most common cancer.This demands the early detection of Breast Cancer.

### How can technology help?

We can use the technology for the early detection of breast cancer, so that it helps the patient to consult with the doctor as early as possible. I also had added the section where user can submit their report to the nearest doctor available in the database. This repository contain the code for deploying ml model in django rst framework.
